 I haven’t thought about this in years, but I can recall the moments of my life that were impacted by technology. I was in the second grade when I first sat down in front of a computer and I was immediately hooked. It was an IBM computer; we were given 30 minutes each day to be on the computer.  I looked forward to my 30 minutes every day. Even though all I did at the time was play trivial games I thought to myself "how amazing it was to give the computer an input like (click the mouse button) and it would return an output like (open an application). Well to be honest I’m sure at seven I didn’t quite think of it like that, but the general idea of my thinking was there. 

When I was about 13 years old my mom surprised me and bought me my first computer. I started to teach myself everything I could about computers. I learned about the hardware first but at around 16 years old, my interest moved to the software side. I wanted to know how applications worked. In my research I came across html. so, I started building my own website from scratch. Eventually I learned a little CSS. As the years went on, I always messed around with coding but never enough to actually do it for a living. Eventually life happened and I became an electrician, but coding was always what I was thinking about. Now I am 35 going on 36 and with all my experiences up until now I realized that we take time for granted. We have one life and we should spend it doing things that make us happy. It is what I teach my kids and it is the way I started to live my life.  So, in February of 2020 I signed up for the Software engineer program at Flatiron school and began my journey to start making my dreams come true. My name is Domenico Cascone future software engineer. Hello class of 2020.
